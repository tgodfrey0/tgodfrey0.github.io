        I'm a postgraduate research student in the [SooratiLab](https://sooratilab.com); part of the [Agents, Interactions & Complexity Research Group](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/groups/agents-interaction-complexity) in the [School of Electronics & Computer Science](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science) at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

        My research is focused on communication-aware command and control of robot swarms, especially in harsh environments. I have extensive experience with robotics, both ground and aerial, and in simulation and the real world.

        Please reach out to collaborate.
